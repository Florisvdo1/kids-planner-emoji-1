**Objective:**  
Expand the existing emoji deck in the drag-and-drop emoji planner by adding more than 300 emojis organized into several categories. Focus the first set of categories on event-related emojis (e.g., driving, walking, yoga) for use in event-based planning. Ensure all new emojis integrate seamlessly with the default emoji deck and can be dragged, dropped, and categorized efficiently.

**Detailed Instructions:**  

1. **Emoji Deck Expansion:**  
   - Add more than 300 new emojis to the emoji planner, grouped by categories for easy navigation.  
   - Begin with event-related categories (e.g., "Activities," "Travel," "Sports," "Health & Wellness") containing relevant emojis. Examples:  
     - **Activities:** 🧘‍♂️, 🚶‍♀️, 🎨, 🎭, 🎤  
     - **Travel:** 🚗, ✈️, 🚢, 🚂, 🏍️  
     - **Sports:** ⚽, 🏀, 🏓, 🏊‍♂️, 🚴‍♀️  
     - **Health & Wellness:** 🛌, 🧘‍♀️, 🚶‍♂️, 💪, 🩺  

2. **Category Organization:**  
   - Organize emojis into clearly defined categories such as:  
     - **Activities:** All task-based or hobby-related emojis.  
     - **Travel:** Emojis related to transportation and destinations.  
     - **Sports:** Emojis for games, physical activities, and competitions.  
     - **Health & Wellness:** Emojis reflecting health, relaxation, and fitness.  
     - Expand further categories to include **Food & Drink, Animals, Weather, Celebrations, and Tools**.  

3. **Integration with Existing Deck:**  
   - Ensure all new emojis are added to the default emoji deck without disrupting the drag-and-drop functionality.  
   - Align new categories with the existing deck structure, using the same styling and organizational hierarchy.  

4. **Drag-and-Drop Functionality:**  
   - Ensure all newly added emojis are draggable and droppable into the event planner interface.  
   - Test functionality across desktop, tablet, and mobile resolutions to maintain responsiveness.  

5. **User Interface Adjustments:**  
   - Update the emoji picker UI to accommodate the expanded emoji deck. Add category tabs or a scrolling feature for efficient navigation.  
   - Use the same font and UI styling already implemented in the app for category headers and emoji labels.  

6. **Testing and Validation:**  
   - Verify all new emojis render correctly across all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).  
   - Test drag-and-drop functionality and confirm that all emojis align visually within the app's interface.  
   - Ensure category filtering and scrolling work seamlessly on all devices.

7. **Examples for Emoji Categories and Emojis:**  
   - **Activities:** 🧘‍♂️ (Yoga), 🎭 (Drama), 🎨 (Painting)
