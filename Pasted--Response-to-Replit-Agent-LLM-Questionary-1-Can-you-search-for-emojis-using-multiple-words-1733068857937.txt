**Response to Replit Agent LLM Questionary:**  

1. **Can you search for emojis using multiple words (e.g., "happy face")?**  
   **No.** The search functionality does not currently support multiple-word queries.  
   - **Action:** Enhance the search functionality to support multi-word queries. For example, allow searches like "happy face" or "red heart" to return relevant emoji results.  

2. **Does the search work when typing an emoji directly?**  
   **Yes.** Typing an emoji directly in the search bar works correctly, and relevant results are displayed.  

3. **Does the empty state show helpful messages?**  
   **Yes.** When no emojis match the search criteria, the empty state displays helpful and user-friendly messages.  

4. **Is the search responsive and quick?**  
   **Yes.** The search functionality is responsive, providing quick and accurate results.

**New Instructions for Integration:**  

1. **Full Emoji Deck Integration:**  
   - Integrate more than 300 new emojis into the emoji deck, distributed across **15+ categories**.  
   - Ensure categories include event-related emojis (e.g., yoga, driving, walking) and others such as **Food, Travel, Sports, Weather, Animals, Celebrations, Tools, and Hobbies**.  
   - Verify that all emojis are fully draggable and categorized for smooth navigation.  
   - Test the emoji deck for responsiveness and consistency across devices.

   - The reset button should:  
     - Erase all placed emojis from the **morning, midday, and evening** planning areas.  
     - Display a confirmation dialog: "Are you sure you want to reset your planned emojis?" with "Yes" and "Cancel" options.  
   - Ensure the button styling matches the app's design, using consistent fonts and colors, and is fully accessible (e.g., `aria-label` added for screen readers).  

3. **Validation and Testing:**  
   - Validate that the expanded emoji deck, reset button, and enhanced search functionality integrate seamlessly.  
   - Test the app thoroughly to ensure no regressions in search, drag-and-drop functionality, or PWA features.  
   - Confirm the reset button works as intended and does not interfere with other UI components.  

**Action Summary:**

- Integrate 300+ emojis across 15+ categories into the emoji deck.  
- Add a reset button beneath the emoji deck to clear all placed emojis.
